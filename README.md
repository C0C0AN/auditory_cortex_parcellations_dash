# Auditory cortex localizations and parcellations (a Dash application)

[<img src=”https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported%20by-%20CONP%2FPCNO-red?link=https://conp.ca/”](https://conp.ca/)

This site is an effort to make scientific data (in this case, auditory cortex localizations and parcellations)
more **standardised**, **accessible**, **interactive**, **useful** and **open**.

It is part of the "Automatic Loclization and Parcellation of Auditory Cortex Areas (ALPACA)" toolbox, summarizing the diverse approaches and resulting regions of interest along with their locations and metadata found in previous and current research. 
It furthermore allows the upload of parcellations that are not indexed and will serve as a tool for meta-analytic approaches.

The ALPACA project logo was made using an amazing freely available alpaca picture from [Max Pixel](http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/Pako-Mammal-Wool-Vicugna-Pacos-Alpaca-Wool-Alpaca-814953) and (cytoarchitectonic) auditory cortex ROIs from [Morosan et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11305897) overlaid on the right hemisphere of [FreeSurfer's fsaverage brain](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). No alpacas were harmed during the creation of this logo.
